#Bootstrap without jQuery
========================

## Introduction

[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/), as of version 2, requires jQuery for some components such as dropdowns, alerts and the little "hamburger" icon that triggers a collapsible menu. While jQuery is an excellent cross-browser framework, it can be overkill if it's only used for displaying and hiding things. Of course, if a project already uses jQuery then there's no problem, but if not here's a script to replace jQuery and the Bootstrap plugin scripts. Using this should reduce download size and speed up loading time for your users.

## Dependencies

- Twitter Bootstrap
- JavaScript turned on - no other libraries required.

## Browser support

Not properly tested yet but I've tried to include support for older versions of IE. I'd really appreciate a quick comment on whether it works in your browser or not.
